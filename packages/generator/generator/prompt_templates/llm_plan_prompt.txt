Task: Plan a short Christian video from user input. Produce 6–10 clips. Each clip must provide LONGER speech (≈8–12 seconds). Some clips can be dialogue, others scripture reading, or both. Choose the best image idea per clip that reflects the words.

Schema:
{
  "title": "string",
  "target_length_sec": number,
  "clips": [
    {
      "index": number,
      "start_sec": number,
      "end_sec": number,
      "mode": "dialogue" | "verse" | "both",
      "dialogue_text": "string | null",        // paraphrased guidance, TTS-friendly
      "verse": { "ref": "Book ch:vs", "text": "string" } | null, // include VERSE TEXT for TTS
      "image_prompt": "string",                 // concrete, single scene, reflects words
      "subtitle": "string"                      // concise on-screen text
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- 6–10 clips. start_sec/end_sec strictly increasing. end_sec > start_sec.
- Aim for 8–12s of speech per clip. Make dialogue_text substantial. If mode is "verse" or "both", include verse.text.
- Dialogue must be biblical and pastoral. Verse.text must be accurate to a widely-used translation (KJV/ESV/NIV style). Keep quotes only in verse.text.
- Do NOT include URLs, watermarks, or typography in image_prompt. Prefer concrete nouns, time of day, lighting, and composition cues. 16:9 framing implied.
- Subtitles summarize the spoken line(s) in ≤ 100 chars.
- Output pure JSON.
